            Lionel Messi rarely gets upstaged on the pitch. The freshly-minted World Cup winner, who was crowned men's player of the year at FIFA's annual award ceremony last weekend, has become accustomed to basking in the public limelight. But on Saturday night, the Argentina maestro was overshadowed by the new king of Paris Saint-Germain.

        <p>
            
Kylian Mbappe's name echoed round Parc des Princes when the French wunderkind became PSG's all-time top scorer with his 201st goal against Nantes. The 24-year-old reached the landmark as he received the ball in the area in stoppage time before firing it home to clinch a 4-2 win.

        <p>Nikola Jokic (#15) of the Denver Nuggets drives in the game against the Memphis Grizzlies at Ball Arena in Denver, Colorado, March 3, 2023</p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The NBA Western Conference leaders Denver Nuggets beat the second-ranking Memphis Grizzlies 113-97 at Ball Arena in Denver, Colorado, on Friday, securing their third straight win and further consolidating their leading position in the conference.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nikola Jokic dropped his 25th triple-double of this season for the Nuggets as he made seven of his 10 field goals (FGs) to score 18 points, 18 rebounds and 10 assists. The team kept a perfect 25-0 record when Jokic generated numbers like this.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Grizzlies continued to miss their injured starting center Steven Adams, who is one of the league's few players that can match Jokic in both size and power. They also lost Brandon Clarke at the end of the first quarter. He suffered a non-contact left leg injury and was helped off the court without putting any weight on his leg.
